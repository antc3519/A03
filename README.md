# Hello! This is a brief tutorial on how to use Webstorm, Git, and Github!

Before you get started with anything you need to make sure you have the software downloaded! Git can be downloaded at: https://git-scm.com/downloads and Webstorm can be downloaded at: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download. After downloading both of these you will need to open Webstorm and create a project by following the tutorial and tips the program gives you! Git and Github are two very useful tools, the first allowing the user to commit projects to Github from which anyone else can access and edit said files and creating a backup in case you accidently delete or mess up any of your files permanently. To do this you will need to open your project in webstorm then on the top navigation bar hover over the VCS Option. From here you will click on Git and follow the directions to link your Github account (if you have not created one simply go to https://www.github.com and create and account). After your account is linked you should see the VCS tab replaced with Git and a new list of actions. To upload your project to Github you will want to press commit, and a new window will open where you will select the repository and files you want to upload and write a brief description about your projects. After pressing commit in the bottom-left corner you will be able to find your project on Github!
